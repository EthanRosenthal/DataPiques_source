    "In this post we're going to do a bunch of cool things following up on the last [post]({filename}/2016-10-19-implicit-mf-part-1.md) introducing implicit matrix factorization. We're going to explore Learning to Rank, a different method for implicit matrix factorization, and then use the library [LightFM](http://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/home.html) to incorporate side information into our recommender. Next, we'll use [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) to be smarter than grid search for cross validating hyperparameters. Lastly, we'll see that we can move beyond simple user-to-item and item-to-item recommendations now that we have side information embedded in the same space as our users and items. Let's go!\n",

    "<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## History lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started working at Birchbox, I was tasked with finding a way to incorporate our rich customer information into the implicit feedback matrix factorization recommendation system. I had no idea what I was doing, so I did a lot of google searching. This proved a difficult problem because there are commonly two paradigms of recommender systems - content-based approaches, like when one has demographic customer data and uses this data to find other similar customers, and \"ratings-based\" approaches, like when one has data on what each user rated each item they interacted with. The desire was for me to marry these two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading through the classic survey article, [Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/papers/ieeecomputer.pdf) (pdf link), revealed a section titled \"Additional Input Sources\". This contains one such approach to incorporating so-called \"side information\" into a recommender system. The idea was relatively simple (well, simple relative to the initial hurdle of wrapping one's head around matrix factorization). Let's say that in a regular matrix factorization model, a user $u$ is represented by a single vector $\\textbf{x}_{u}$ containing that user's latent factors (see previous posts for more background on this). Now, let's say that we have some demographic information about that user like \n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature        | Value           |\n",
    "|:-------------|:-------------|\n",
    "| gender      | Female |\n",
    "| age_bucket      | 25-34      |\n",
    "| income_bucket | $65-79K      |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can one-hot-encode each of these features into an \"attribute-space\" $A$ and assume that each each attribute $a$ has its own latent vector $\\textbf{s}_{a}$. Lastly, we make the assumption that our \"total\" user vector is the original user vector $\\textbf{x}_{u}$ plus each of the relevant attribute vectors. If $N(u)$ represents the set of attributes that pertain to user $u$, then the total user vector is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{x}_{u} + \\sum\\limits_{a \\in N(u)}\\textbf{s}_{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can make the same set of assumptions for side information about the items, and now you can not only achieve better results with your recommendations, but you can also learn vectors and consequently similarities between the side information vectors. For a general overview of this, see a [post](https://making.dia.co/hiring-data-scientists-a-classification-problem-456affe73592#.pk693a7x0) I wrote for Dia&Co's [tech blog](https://making.dia.co/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the approach is clear, so presumably we just add this to last post's implicit feedback objective function and solve, right? Well, I ran the math, and unfortunately this is not scalable. With the extra set of side information vectors, last post's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) becomes a three-way alternating problem. There was a special trick in that ALS optimization that exploited the sparsity of the data to scale the computation. Alas, this trick cannot be used during the stage of ALS where one is solving for the side information vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what to do now?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning to Rank - BPR\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is another method of optimizing implicit feedback matrix factorization problems which is neither ALS nor conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on last post's objective function. This method of optimization typically goes by the name [Learning to Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank) and originated in information retrieval theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic method of using Learning to Rank with implicit feedback was in the paper [BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2618.pdf) (pdf link) first-authored by Steffen Rendle who is kind of a badass in all things implicit and factorized. The idea is centered around sampling *positive* and *negative* items and running pairwise comparisons. Let's assume that for this example our dataset consists of the number of times users have clicked on various items on a website. BPR proceeds as follows (in simplified form):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly select a user $u$ and then select a random item $i$ which the user has clicked on. This is our *positive* item.\n",
    "2. Randomly select an item $j$ which the user has clicked on $fewer$ times than item $i$ (this includes items that they have never clicked). This is our *negative* item.\n",
    "3. Use whatever equation you want to predict the \"score\", $p_{ui}$, for user $u$ and positive item $i$. For matrix factorization, this may be $\\textbf{x}_{u} \\cdot \\textbf{y}_{i}$.\n",
    "4. Predict the score for user $u$ and negative item $j$, $p_{uj}$.\n",
    "5. Find the difference between the positive and negative scores $x_{uij} = p_{ui} - p_{uj}$.\n",
    "6. Pass this difference through a sigmoid and use it as a weighting for updating all of the model parameters via stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method seemed kind of radical to me when I first read it. Notably, we do not care about the actual value of the score that we are predicting. All we care about is that we rank items which the user has clicked on more frequently higher than items which the user has clicked on fewer times. And thus, our model \"learns to rank\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this model employs a sampling-based approach, the authors show that it can be quite fast and scalable relative to other, slower methods. Additionally, the authors argue that BPR directly optimizes the area under the ROC curve (AUC) which could be a desirable characteristic. Most importantly for me, it allows one to easily add in side information without blowing up the computational speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning to Rank - WARP\n",
    "\n",
    "A close relative of BPR is Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise loss (WARP loss) first introduced in [WSABIE: Scaling Up To Large Vocabulary Image Annotation](http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/papers/wsabie-ijcai.pdf) by Weston et. al. WARP is quite similar to BPR: you sample a positive and negative item for a user, predict for both, and take the difference. In BPR you then make the SGD update with this difference as a weight. In WARP, you only run the SGD update if you predict *wrong*, i.e. you predict the negative item has a higher score than the positive item. If you do not predict wrong, then you keep drawing negative items until you either get the prediction wrong or reach some cutoff value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the WARP paper claim that this process shifts from optimizing AUC in BPR to optimizing the precision @ k. The seems likely more relevant for most recommender systems, and I usually have better luck optimizing WARP loss over BPR loss. WARP does introduce two hyperparameters, though. One is the margin which determines how wrong your prediction must be to implement the SGD update. In the paper, the margin is 1 meaning you must guess $p_{uj} \\gt p_{ui} + 1$ to implement the SGD update. The other hyperparameter is the cutoff which determines how many times you're willing to draw negative samples trying to get a wrong prediction before you give up and move on to the next user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sampling approach causes WARP to run quickly when it starts training because you easily get predictions wrong with an untrained model. After training, though, WARP will run slower because it has to sample and predict many items until it gets a wrong prediction and can update. Sounds like a positive problem if it's hard to get your model to predict wrong, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LightFM\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to my Birchbox story. I originally implemented BPR with side information in pure numpy and scipy. This proved to be quite slow, and around that time the [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) package was open sourced by the people at Lyst. LightFM is written in Cython and is paralellized via HOGWILD SGD. This blew my code out of the water, and I happily switched over to LightFM.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightFM uses the same method as above to incorporate side information - it assumes that the total \"user vector\" is the sum of each of the user's relevant side information vectors (which it calls user \"features) and treats the items analogously. Above, we assumed that we had two types of latent vectors: $\\textbf{x}_{u}$ and $\\textbf{s}_{a}$. LightFM treats everything as side information, or features. If we want to have a specific user vector for user $u$, then we must one-hot-encode that as a single feature for that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and install LightFM, read in our good old Sketchfab \"likes\" data as well as the model tags, and see if we can get better results with LightFM than we did last post using classic ALS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "LightFM is on pypi, so you can install simplest with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install lightfm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a mac, then you will unfortunately not be able to run your code in parallel out of the box. If you would like to use parallelization, you must first make sure you have gcc which can be installed with ```brew```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install gcc --without-multilib\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be careful, this takes like 30 minutes. The simplest way I've then found to building LightFM is to trick it. First clone the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:lyst/lightfm.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, open ```setup.py``` go to where the variable ```use_openmp``` is defined, and hard set it to ```True```. Then, ```cd lightfm && pip install -e .```\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that done, let's write some code to train some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "I took a lot of the functions used last time for arranging the Sketchfab data into a matrix and placed them all in a ```helpers.py``` file in the rec-a-sketch repo."

    "Now that we have a baseline, we would like to find optimal hyperparameters to maximize our p@k. On a side note, I'm not sure if precision at k is the best metric to be using here when all of our interactions are binary, but let's just ignore that for now...\n",
    "\n",
    "Last post I ran a grid search over a bunch of hyperparameters, and it took forever. It's been shown that a randomized search is better than explicit grid search, but we can do even better. Using the [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) (```skopt```) library, we can treat the hyperpameters as free parameters to search over while using a black box optimization algorithm to maximize p@k. There are a number of optimization algorithms to pick from, but I'll just stick with ```forest_minimize``` today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup is pretty simple. You must first define an objective function that you want to minimize. The objective receives the parameters that you want to solve for as the arguments and returns the objective value at those parameters. Thus, for our case, we pass in the hyperparameters, we train the ```LightFM``` model with those parameters, and then return the p@k evaluated after training. Importantly, we must return the negative of the p@k because the objective must be *minimized*, so maximizing p@k is the same as minimizing the negative of the p@k. The last thing to note is that one must make liberal use of global variables because one can only pass hyperparameters to the objective function."

    "```LightFM``` makes certain subtle assumptions when you do or do not pass side information. When no ```user_features``` or ```item_features``` are explicitly included, then ```LightFM``` assumes that both feature matrices are in fact identity matrices of size (```num_users``` X ```num_users```) or (```num_items``` X ```num_items```) for user and item feature matrices, respectively. What this is effectively doing is one-hot-encoding each user and item ID as a single feature vector. In the case where you do pass an ```item_features``` matrix, then ```LightFM``` does not do any one-hot-encoding. Thus, each user and item ID does not get its own vector unless you explicitly define one. The easiest way to do this is to make your own identity matrix and stack it on the side of the ```item_features``` matrix that we already created. This way, each item is described by a single vector for its unique ID and then a set of vectors for each of its tags."

In all fairness, I only ran the above optimization for 50 calls, as opposed to the original one with 250 calls. This was mainly due to the matrix factorization model running much slower due to scaling with the number of user and item features. \n",

The tag information could be poor for some of the models. As well, one may need to scale the tags *differently* compared to the unique ID vectors using, say, separate regularization terms, in order to get better behavior. Maybe one should normalize the tag weights by the number of tags. Maybe tags should not be included unless they have been used on at least ```X``` models. Maybe tags should only be included on models with few user interactions because after that ponit the cold start problem is sufficiently null. Who knows?!

    "Let's say that Sketchfab would like to encourage people to use more tags. This is advantageous to the company because it get users to create structured data for them for free while engaging the user. Sketchfab could encourage this behavior by suggesting tags to go with an image. One way we could do this would be to take a model and suggest tags to go with it that are not currently there. This involves finding tag vectors that are most similar to the model and then filtering tags that are already present."

    "So this post was long. There was a lot to learn and a lot of parameters to optimize. I'd like to note that, in terms of out of the box performance, it's hard to beat the ALS model from last post. There's fewer parameters to optimize, and the model is much more \"forgiving\" of being a bit off in your hyperparameters. Contrastingly, if your learning rate is poor, then SGD will give you *nothing* in return. It is definitely possible to beat ALS in performance, though, if you spend enough time fiddling around. Moreover, the ability to incorporate side information is important for being able to make new types of recommendations and overcome the cold start problem, so it's good to have this in your toolbox."
